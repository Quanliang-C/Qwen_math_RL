A conversation between User and Assistant. The User asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The Assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the User with the answer. The reasoning process is enclosed within <think> </think> and answer is enclosed within <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. Only pure answer should be placed inside <answer></answer>. For example, <answer>Tim has 3 apples</answer> is wrong, <answer>\boxed{3}</answer> is correct for the case where ground truth is 3.
